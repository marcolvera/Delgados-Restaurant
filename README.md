## Delgado's Restaraunt

---

## Description

This project is freelance work for a local restaraunt located in San Jacinto, CA. I decided to follow the popular landing them of a vibrant picture with text on top. It's a very minimal approach and it works well here. A lot of thought was put into the color scheme as I wanted to make sure the website reflected the attitude and atmoshpere of the pyshical restaraunt. Utilized media queries to make it responsive and collapse sections for a mobile friendly experience. Currently only repsonsive on 640px width.
