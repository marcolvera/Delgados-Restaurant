## Landing Page

A lot of focus was put on creating a warm and inviting landing page. The theme of the site had to also represent the physical appearance and attitude of the restaurant. Decided on following popular minimal approach with an image and text on top. The choice to add a dark gradient to the image was made to ensure the text is clearly visible and vibrant.

## Brief

The two goals of the landing page was to capture the users attention and intice them to see the menu page. The first section with the image and text is the capture. The following section with several food images is to persuade. The choice to use bright food images was to make them pop and popular items were described briefly to encourage the user to get more information from the menu page.
